# Chess Memory Game

A React-based chess memory game where players recreate a shown position from memory, then get scored automatically via board-state comparison. Features adaptive difficulty (harder positions as accuracy improves), chess.com-inspired UI styling, and a Lichess-scraped position dataset for endless variety.
